            <p>Researched & Explored patterns consistent with dormant customers in a bid to improve customer retention by 
                understanding customer behavior and Identifying existing customers that are about to stop transacting with the business.</p>
            <p>To do this, a supervised learning approach was used to distinguish the unique pattern of an active client against a 
                dormant client with the objective of mitigating dormancy.</p>
            <p>This was achieved by leveraging exhaustive data on customer's demographics, transactional data,
                 Interactions data, & digital channels data from their respective internal databases.
            </p>
            <p>This initiative was able to identify several customers with high potential to churn & who account for over N200bn in AUM 
                to be engaged by the customer experience team.</p>

        <div class="Project-Fraud__body">
            <p>This use case involved extensive research on the transactional behaviour of each of the customers.
                The objective was to automate the tracking and identification of suspicious transactions made by each customer 
                in a bid to reduce the overall man-hours spent by the Fraud team in manually identifying and resolving these cases.
            </p>
            <p>The general hypothesis was that each customer has a unique transactional pattern, and when there's an anomaly in 
                the transactional pattern of a customer, then it should be flagged and escalated to the appropriate team for resolution.
            </p>
            <p>This initiative leveraged unsupervised machine learning & deep learning models for anomaly detection, 
                and was deployed as part of a fully scalable, end-to-end solution that is currently being adopted by one of the top 
                financial institutions in Nigeria.

            </p>
            <p>This initiative required querying of SQL databases, and leveraging big data frameworks (including, 
                but not limited to PySpark, Hive) on Hadoop clusters to extract, transform, load, and test the client's data.
